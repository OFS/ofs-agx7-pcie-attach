File/Directory:
   * rtl_comb_common.f    - Contains design RTL files that are common across platforms except Intel Quartus IP files.
   * rtl_comb.f           - Contain platform specific design RTL files except Intel Quartus IP files. 
   * ip_flist.sh          - Contain Intel Quartus IP file list. This file is auto-generated by gen_ip_flist.sh and to be sourced by simulation test cases
   * vcs_filelist.sh      - Top level filelist to be sourced by simulation test cases   
   * gen_ip_flist.sh      - Generate ip_flist.sh from ${OFS_ROOTDIR}/syn/setup/ip_list.f
   * qip_sim_script       - Contain top level Intel Quartus IP simulation script. The script is auto-generated by gen_ip_sim_setup.sh
   * gen_ip_sim_setup.sh  - Generate top level Intel Quartus IP simulation script in qip_sim_script from ${OFS_ROOTDIR}/syn/n6000/base/setup/ip_list.f
   * build_vcsmx_iplib.sh - Pre-build IP libraries that can be used for simulation in VCSMX simulator by calling the simulation script in qip_sim_script.

VCS Simulation
   * Use rtl_comb_common.f, rtl_comb.f, ip_flist.sh and vcs_filelist.sh

VCSMX Simulation
   * Use rtl_comb_common.f, rtl_comb.f, ip_flist.sh and vcs_filelist.sh
   * IP libraries can be pre-build by calling build_vcsmx_iplib.sh. The script will compile the IP into ./ip_libraries
