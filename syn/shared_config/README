Tcl scrips here import RTL and other IP into a FIM build or into an AFU partial
reconfiguration (PR) build. The majority of the scripts are used only during
a FIM base build. Scripts with the name *afu_if* import interfaces and packages
describing data structures passed to AFUs and are used during PR synthesis
as well.

Only sources that describe an AFU interface and are required for PR builds
should be listed in *afu_if*.tcl files.
