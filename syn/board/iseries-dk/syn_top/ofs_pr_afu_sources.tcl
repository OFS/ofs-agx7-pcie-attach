# the base FIM build.

# during the FIM build but is not required for PR. Defining the namespace
# prevents errors in Tcl files that are shared by FIM and PR builds.

##### AFU <- Keep this tag. The pattern is used by scripts to update AFU sources.

# OPAE_PLATFORM_GEN is set when a script is generating the PR build environment
# used with OPAE SDK tools. The Verilog macro is consumed in the PIM variant
# of afu_main, causing afu_main to act as a simple template that defines the module
# but doesn't include an actual AFU.

    # In OPAE_PLATFORM_GEN mode, no additional sources are loaded. The goal is
    # to configure the minimal environment required to define AFU interfaces and
    # instantiate the top-level PR module.

    # In non-OPAE_PLATFORM_GEN mode, a sample PR AFU is configured using the
    # FIM-provided exercisers. These sources are required for those exercisers,
    # but are unlikely to be required by other AFUs.
